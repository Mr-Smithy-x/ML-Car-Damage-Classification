# Detecting Car Damaged with Binary Classification

Binary classification is basically choosing between 0 and 1.
the cut off point is 0.5. if the prediction is `0.83` then that indicates that the car is not damaged. if the prediction is 0.41 then that indicates that the car is damaged.


# Multi-Class Classification

In this notebook we will discover how we can go from using a binary classification model to using a multi-class classification model.

Multi-class classification is commonly used to determine what is described in the photo. We will go over how we can build our own classifier see the performance and improve the performance using transfer learning (A powerful way to transfer what another model learned into your own SOTA model)
